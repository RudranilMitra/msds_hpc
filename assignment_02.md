# JUWELS Booster Module
•	Hardware Used

o	CPU: AMD EPYC 7402 processor; 2 sockets, 24 cores per socket, SMT-2 (total: 2×24×2 = 96 threads) in NPS-4 1 configuration (details on WikiChip)
o	Memory: 512 GB DDR4-3200 RAM (of which at least 20 GB is taken by the system software stack, including the file system); 256 GB per socket; 8 memory channels per socket (2 channels per NUMA domain)
o	GPU: 4 × NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU with 40 GB; connected via NVLink3 to each other
o	Network: 4 × Mellanox HDR200 InfiniBand ConnectX 6 (200 Gbit/s each), HCA
o	Periphery: CPU, GPU, and network adapter are connected via 2 PCIe Gen 4 switches with 16 PCIe lanes going to each device (CPU socket: 2×16 lanes). PCIe switches are configured in synthetic mode.

•	JUWELS will be used to model Human Brain. Organize and disseminate data describing the brain and its diseases at an unprecedented scale. Models the human brain with about 86 billion neurons and 100 trillion connectors

# HPC5
•	Hardware Used

o	820 Dell EMC PowerEdge C4140 nodes, each with 2 Intel Gold 6252 24-core CPUs
o	4 NVIDIA V100 GPU accelerators.
o	Infiniband Mellanox HDR ultra-high-performance network with a speed of 200 Gbit/s, using over 10 km of fibre-optic cable. 
o	HPC5 comes with a high-performance 15-petabyte storage system (200 GB/s aggregate read/write speeds).

•	the peak computational capacity of the infrastructure totals 70 petaFlops

•	70 million billion mathematical operations performed in a single second.

•	The geophysical and seismic information we collect from all over the world is sent to HPC5 for processing. Using this data, the system develops extremely in-depth subsoil models, and on the basis of these, we can determine what is hidden many kilometres below the surface: indeed, this is how we found Zohr, the largest gas field ever discovered in the Mediterranean.
